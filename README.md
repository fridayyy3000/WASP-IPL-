Winning and Score Predictor (WASP) is a calculation tool used in cricket to predict the scores and possible results of a limited over match format. For the team batting first, it gives the prediction of the final total. For the team batting second, it predicts the probability of
the chasing team winning. Cricket is a game of unpredictability, especially in the context of the T20 league like IPL(Indian Premier League) where every run and every wicket can significantly impact the result of the match. In this project we have combined different machine learning algorithms to predict the score likely to be achieved by the team batting first and to find the winning probability for the team batting second.
